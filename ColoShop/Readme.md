# ColoShop API Site

**ColoShop** is an e-commerce platform that dynamically fetches product information via an API. The website showcases the latest Spring/Summer 2025 collection and provides users with an engaging shopping experience.

## Features

- **Product Display**: Products are fetched from an external API and displayed in an organized, responsive layout.
- **Categories**: View products categorized for easier navigation.
- **Cart Management**: Users can add/remove items to/from their cart, with real-time updates.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **API Integration**: The site pulls data from an API to keep product listings up-to-date with the backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API**: RESTful API for fetching product details, images, and prices.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal display on both mobile and desktop devices.

## How It Works

This website relies on a third-party API to display product listings dynamically. Here's how the core functionality is implemented:

1. **API Fetching**: The site uses JavaScript (with fetch API or Axios) to retrieve product data from a backend API.
2. **Product Catalog**: Data such as product names, images, and prices are rendered dynamically on the homepage.
3. **Cart**: Users can interact with the cart by adding products, and their selections are stored in the local storage to persist during browsing.
4. **Responsive Layout**: Uses CSS Flexbox and Grid to create a fluid layout, adjusting elements based on screen size.
