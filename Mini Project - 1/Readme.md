# Mini Project - 1

This project is based on enhancing the javascript knowledge

## Description
This mini-project is a responsive, interactive To-Do List Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project allows users to manage their tasks dynamically, offering features like adding tasks, removing tasks, moving tasks between lists, and persisting data using browser localStorage. The application is designed to be user-friendly, functional across various screen sizes, and ensures data persistence across page reloads or browser restarts.

## Features
### 1. Add Users
* Users can input a task name in a text box and add it to the To-Do List by clicking the "ADD ITEM" button.
Tasks are immediately displayed in the To-Do List with a selectable format.

### 2. Move task between lists
* To-Do List: Contains tasks that are yet to be completed.
Complete List: Contains tasks that have been marked as completed.

* To the Right: Moves selected tasks from the To-Do List to the Complete List.
To the Left: Moves selected tasks from the Complete List back to the To-Do List.


### 3. Remove Selected Items
* A "REMOVE" button enables users to delete any selected task from either list.


### 4. Selection of Tasks
* Tasks can be selected by clicking on them. Selected tasks are visually highlighted for easy identification.

### 5. Responsive Design
* The application adjusts its appearance based on screen size:
The heading and button text adapt dynamically for smaller or larger screens.
Buttons display "MOVE TO DOWN" and "MOVE TO UP" for smaller screens, replacing "MOVE TO RIGHT" and "MOVE TO LEFT."

### 6. Data Storage in browser using "localStorage"
* The application stores the task data (text and selection state) in the browser's localStorage.
* Tasks remain saved even if the page is refreshed or the browser is reopened.
